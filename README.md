# UK Job Market Analysis with Machine Learning  

##  Project Overview  
This project explores recruitment patterns in the UK job market using a customized dataset based on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) labour demand volumes. The dataset contains indices of online job adverts across UK Local Authority Districts by Standard Occupation Classification (SOC 2020), spanning **January 2017 – August 2024**.  

The analysis was carried out as part of the MSc Data Science module COMP1886(University of Greenwich), but is presented here as a complete applied project in **data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning**.

##  Objectives  
- Analyse UK recruitment trends across regions and occupations.  
- Apply preprocessing techniques to improve data quality.  
- Develop and evaluate supervised ML models for both prediction and classification tasks.  
- Present findings in both **notebooks** and a **professional report**.

## Repository Contents  
- **`notebooks/`** – Python notebooks implementing each task (EDA, preprocessing, prediction, classification).  
- **`report/`** – Final PDF report summarising analysis, visualisations, and findings.  
- **`requirements.txt`** – Python dependencies for running the code.  
- **`data/`** – Coursework dataset.
-  **`Others/`** – Other visualisations used during the project (Some are not included in the report).
